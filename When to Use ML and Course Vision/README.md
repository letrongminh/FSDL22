# 1 - Course history

Now in 2022, there's a proliferation of powerful products that are powered by ML. The narrative has shifted as well: There's standardization that has emerged around the tech stack - with transformers and NLP starting to seep their way into more use cases, as well as practices around how to apply ML technologies in the world. One of the biggest changes in the field in the past four years has been the emergence of the term MLOps.

In addition to the field being more mature and research continuing to progress, a big reason for this rapid change is that **the training of models is starting to become commoditized**.


- With tools like [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), you can deploy a state-of-the-art NLP or CV model in one or two lines of code.
- AutoML is starting to work for a lot of applications.
- Companies like OpenAI are starting to provide models as a service where you don't even have to download open-source packages to use them. You can make a network call to get predictions from a state-of-the-art model.
- Many libraries are starting to standardize around frameworks like [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/).
